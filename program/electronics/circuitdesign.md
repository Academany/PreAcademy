* [Drawing your circuits](#drawing-your-circuits)
* [Eagle](#eagle)
* [KiCAD](#kicad)

Welcome to the amazing world of electronics design. We will learn tools and acquire some skills to be able to design our own circuit boards, which together with the skills of Electronics Production will allow us to fabricate our own circuit boards. And this is not only super cool, but also a huge step in digital fabrication. There are several ways you can create your electronics design. These are just some that we will cover:

* Drawing your circuit boards by hand. With the help of a template
* Using [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)

Remember that in any case, what you will obtain is a black and white `.png` image for [fab modules](http://fabmodules.org) or [mods](http://mods.cba.mit.edu).

## Drawing your circuits

## Eagle

Even if you are not planning to use Eagle you **still ~~have~~ want to know the basics of Eagle** because you will find many designs out there using this format. You have to learn how to create the Schematic Design first and then the Design Layout. These are two half an hour tutorials:
