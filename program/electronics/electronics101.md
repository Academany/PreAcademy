## Learning about components

Let's learn a little bit about how the components work. A good resource is the O'Reilly Encyclopedia of Electronic Components[.](files/books.zip) Do you know what are these components for and how do they work?

## Power sources

## Decoupling Capacitor

## Finding the value of a LED Resistor

## Pull-up and pull-down resistors

## Resonators and crystals

## Diodes and LEDs

## Regulator

## Using the multimeter

## Using the oscilloscope

## Using the function generator

## Microcontrollers

### Fuses

TODO the avr fuse calculator
